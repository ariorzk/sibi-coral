# sibi-coral

This project is my undergraduate thesis project. The goal is to recognize hand gesture from Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia (SIBI) sign language. The hardware that I'm using is Google Coral Dev Board to run the recognition model and Camera to capture the image. This is very much a work in progress so don't expect too much from me, I'm also still learning about Machine Learning and programming in general.
